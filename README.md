# summerinternship_D22IT204Week 1: The Humble Calculator
My Flutter adventure began with a timeless classic - a basic calculator app! This seemingly simple project laid the groundwork for my understanding of core Flutter concepts. Here's what a typical week looked like:

Day 1 & 2: Setting Up the Foundation (Ô∏è):
Installed Flutter and configured the development environment. Learned about widgets, the building blocks of Flutter UIs. Explored layout options like rows, columns, and stacks.

Day 3 & 4: Bringing Buttons to Life (Ô∏è):
Implemented buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like clear. Handled user input by capturing button presses and updating the display. Wrote logic to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Day 5: Polishing and Testing (‚ú®):
Added visual elements like text styles and spacing for a user-friendly interface. Tested the app thoroughly to ensure accurate calculations and functionality.

Week 2: Conquering Chaos with a To-Do App ‚úÖ
Week two presented a more practical challenge - a to-do list app. Here, I honed my skills in creating a user interactive interface and managing application state.

Day 1: Designing the Task List ():
Defined the UI structure for displaying existing tasks. Created a widget to represent each individual task item.

Day 2 & 3: Adding and Removing Tasks (‚ûï‚ûñ):
Implemented functionality to add new tasks to the list. Wrote logic for users to remove completed tasks (with a satisfying check mark, of course ‚úÖ).

Day 4: State Management Magic (ü™Ñ):
Introduced the concept of state management to keep track of added/removed tasks. Explored libraries like Provider or BLoC for state management (choose the one you used).

Day 5: User Interface Refinement ():
Added features like task completion toggle and the ability to edit existing tasks. Polished the UI for a clean and intuitive user experience.

Week 3: Keeping Time with a Stopwatch ‚è±Ô∏è
Week three shifted the focus to building a dynamic and interactive app with the creation of a stopwatch.

Day 1: Understanding Timers (‚è≤Ô∏è):
Learned about Flutter's timer functionality for managing elapsed time. Explored different timer types (periodic, single-shot) for building the stopwatch.

Day 2 & 3: Building Stopwatch Controls (Ô∏è):
Implemented buttons for start, stop, and reset functionalities. Connected button presses to update the timer and display the elapsed time.

Day 4: Displaying Time with Style (‚è±Ô∏è):
Designed a user interface element to display the stopwatch time in a clear and readable format. Added functionalities like pausing and resuming the timer.

Day 5: Optimization and Testing ():
Optimized the code for performance and efficient timer management. Tested the stopwatch app rigorously to ensure accurate timekeeping.

Week 4: Tic Tac Toe - The Two-Player Challenge üÜö
The final week presented the most complex challenge - a two-player tic tac toe game. This project required advanced skills in user interaction and game logic implementation.

Day 1 & 2: Building the Game Board ():
Designed the tic tac toe game board layout using Flutter widgets. Implemented logic to represent each cell on the board with a visual indicator (empty, X, or O).

Day 3 & 4: Player Interaction and Turn Management (Ô∏è):
Built functionality for players to take turns by tapping on empty cells. Implemented logic to check for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals). Designed a system to handle turn changes and game state updates.

Day 5: Game Over and Reset (/):
Added functionality to detect game over scenarios (win, draw). Implemented a reset button to start a new game. Polished the UI for a visually appealing game experience.
